It can easily be closed off to make it a fully private bedroom. Fun fact: the original owner, who's an architect, designed it that way!  The condo has tons of storage, sleek cabinetry in the kitchen, stainless steel appliances, travertine flooring, granite counters, and a full-size washer and dryer. Step outside to your own private terrace with nice views of the community.","173-33-452","","","CLIENTS OF SERHANT. & FHG","","","Optima Inc","2025-06-27 18:43:51.530159","","T","Scottsdale","No","N","Fee Simple","","ER","Kiva","Mohave","Saguaro High","","","1471","","","1264.00","173.00","33.00","452.00","2025-06-27","SCOTTSDALE ROAD AND HIGHLAND","OPTIMA CAMELVIEW VILLAGE CONDOMINIUM AMD","Stacked","","0.0290","","N","","","","N","","N","Y","http://cdn.photos.sparkplatform.com/az/20250528004307981489000000.jpg","30","","Additional Bedroom|Master Bedroom Walk-in Closet|Yes;Architecture|Contemporary|Yes;Association & Fees|HOA Y/N|Y;Association & Fees|Other Fees Description|Electric Deposit & Admin Fee;Association & Fees|Other Fees HOA|460;Association & Fees|Disclosure Fees HOA|400;Association & Fees|Prepaid Association Fees HOA|1,639.68;Association & Fees|Special Assessment HOA|No;Association & Fees|HOA Disclosure/Addendum Affirmation|Yes;Association & Fees|Cap Improvement/Impact Fee $/%|$;Association & Fees|Ttl Mthly Fee Equiv|819.84;Association & Fees|Land Lease Fee Y/N|N;Association & Fees|PAD Fee Y/N|N;Association & Fees|HOA Management Company|AAM LLC;Association & Fees|HOA 2 Y/N|N;Association & Fees|Cap Improvement/Impact Fee|2,459.52;Association & Fees|HOA Transfer Fee|1,639.68;Association & Fees|Rec Center Fee Y/N|N;Association & Fees|HOA Telephone|480-245-7560;Association & Fees|HOA Name|Optima HOA;Association & Fees|HOA Paid Frequency|Monthly;Association & Fees|HOA Fee|819.84;Building Style|Clustered|Yes;Community Features|Community Pool|Yes;Community Features|Workout Facility|Yes;Community Features|Pickleball|Yes;Community Features|Clubhouse/Rec Room|Yes;Community Features|Near Bus Stop|Yes;Community Features|On-Site Guard|Yes;Community Features|Concierge|Yes;Community Features|Community Spa Htd|Yes;Community Features|Community Spa|Yes;Community Pool Features|Heated|Yes;Contact Info|List Agent Home Phn|602-391-3661;Contact Info|List Agent Cell Phn|602-391-3661;Contact Info|List Agt Primary Phn|602-391-3661;Exterior Features|Balcony|Yes;Flooring|Carpet|Yes;Flooring|Stone|Yes;Interior Features|9+ Flat Ceilings|Yes;Interior Features|No Interior Steps|Yes;Interior Features|Fire Sprinkler System|Yes;Legal Info|Township|2N;Legal Info|Lot Number|2010;Legal Info|Section|22;Legal Info|Range|4E;Parking Features|Over Height Garage|Yes;Parking Features|Permit/Decal Req'd|Yes;Parking Features|Gated|Yes;Parking Features|Community Structure|Yes;Parking Features|Garage Door Opener|Yes;Parking Features|Assigned Parking|Yes;Parking Spaces|Garage Spaces|1;Parking Spaces|Total Covered Spaces|1;Parking Spaces|Slab Parking Spaces|0;Parking Spaces|Carport Spaces|0;Property Access|Lockbox Location|Lockbox Wall;Services|City Services|Yes;Showing Instructions|Permission Required to Show|Yes;Showing Notification Methods|Showing Service|Aligned Showings;Showing Notification Methods|Phone Call|Yes;Showing Notification Methods|Text|Yes;Sold Info|Loan Type|Cash;Sold Info|Buyer Concession $/%|$;Sold Info|Seller Concession $/%|$;Sold Info|Seller Concession to Buyer|0;Sold Info|Buyer Concession to Seller|0;Sold Info|Closing Cost Split|Normal - N;Technology|Pre-Wire Sat Dish|Yes;Technology|High Speed Internet|Yes;Technology|Cable TV Avail|Yes;Unit Style|All on One Level|Yes;Unit Style|Neighbor Above|Yes;Window Features|Dual Pane|Yes;Basement|Basement Y/N|N;Occupant - DND2|Vacant|Yes;Separate Den/Office|Sep Den/Office Y/N|Y;Possession|Close of Escrow|Yes;Spa|None|Yes;Heating|Electric|Yes;Lockbox Type|Supra|Yes;Water Source|City Water|Yes;Disclosures|Seller Discl Avail|Yes;Disclosures|Agency Discl Req|Yes;Cooling|Central Air|Yes;Dining Area|Breakfast Bar|Yes;Existing 1st Loan|Treat as Free&Clear|Yes;Sewer|Sewer - Public|Yes;Const - Finish|Other (See Remarks)|Yes;Utilities|SRP|Yes;Utilities|SW Gas|Yes;Fencing|Partial|Yes;Master Bathroom|Full Bth Master Bdrm|Yes;Master Bathroom|Double Vanity|Yes;Private Pool Features|No Pool|Yes;Laundry|Washer Included|Yes;Laundry|Inside|Yes;Laundry|Stacked Washer/Dryer|Yes;Laundry|Dryer Included|Yes;Roofing|Concrete|Yes;Construction|Steel Frame|Yes;Assoc Rules/Info|Pets OK (See Rmrks)|Yes;Assoc Rules/Info|Rental OK (See Rmks)|Yes;New Financing|Cash|Yes;New Financing|Conventional|Yes;New Financing|FHA|Yes;New Financing|VA|Yes;Special Listing Cond|N/A|Yes;Association Fee Incl|Roof Repair|Yes;Association Fee Incl|Common Area Maint|Yes;Association Fee Incl|Gas|Yes;Association Fee Incl|Sewer|Yes;Association Fee Incl|Water|Yes;Association Fee Incl|Blanket Ins Policy|Yes;Association Fee Incl|Roof Replacement|Yes;Landscaping|None|Yes;Kitchen Features|Dishwasher|Yes;Kitchen Features|Range/Oven Elec|Yes;Kitchen Features|Granite Counters|Yes;Kitchen Features|Reverse Osmosis|Yes;Kitchen Features|Built-in Microwave|Yes;Kitchen Features|Gas Cooktop|Yes;Kitchen Features|Refrigerator|Yes;Kitchen Features|Disposal|Yes;"
