## 1. Executive Summary

### Core Concept

**Taglines:**
- "Quality via Quantity"
- "Quick as a Wabbit"

### Mission

Human-in-the-loop content ranking for generative AI outputs. Wabbit enables teams to rapidly evaluate bulk-generated content and reach consensus on the highest-ROI pieces.

### Thesis

Better bulk generation process for high ROI content with team consensus. The platform bridges the gap between AI's ability to generate unlimited variations and human judgment on what actually works.

### Key Value Propositions

1. **Speed**: Rank 100+ outputs in minutes, not hours
2. **Collaboration**: Team voting with weighted expertise
3. **Integration**: Connects to existing creative workflows (Slack, Figma, Notion)
4. **Learning**: AI improves based on team ranking patterns

## 9. Marketing & Psychology

### 9.1 Deck's Psych

#### Work Displacement Maximization
> The goal isn't to replace work, it's to displace low-value work with high-value work.

Ranking AI outputs is currently high-effort, low-efficiency. Wabbit makes it low-effort, high-efficiency.

#### B2EC vs B2B Strategy

**B2EC (Educated Consumer) First:**
- Lower sales cycle
- Viral potential
- Community building
- Product feedback loop

**B2B Later:**
- Higher ACV
- Longer sales cycle
- Enterprise features required
- Sales team needed

#### Marketing as Moat

> "1.2x leaps lead to 50% usage jumps. Goal: 16 leaps."

Each 1.2x improvement in marketing quality compounds. 16 such improvements = massive advantage.

**The Flywheel:**
1. Use Wabbit to rank our own marketing content
2. Best content performs better
3. Better performance = more data
4. More data = better AI recommendations
5. Better AI = better content ranked
6. Repeat

### 9.2 Content Plan

#### "Free Sauce" PRD Builds
Give away valuable playbooks/templates that showcase Wabbit:
- AI image generation workflow PRD
- Video content ranking system
- Team feedback aggregation guide

#### Hook - Value - Tag Structure

Every piece of content follows:
1. **Hook**: Attention-grabbing opener (2-3 seconds)
2. **Value**: Actual useful information (10-30 seconds)
3. **Tag**: Call to action + product tie-in (2-3 seconds)

#### ESPN Top THREE Format
Sports-style highlight format:
1. #3 pick with context
2. #2 pick with context
3. #1 pick with reveal and celebration

### 9.3 Influencer Strategy

#### Agency Learning Approach
- Partner with existing agencies
- Learn their workflows
- Build for their needs
- They become advocates

#### Quantity Focus
> More attempts = more data = faster learning

Volume of outreach and content matters more than perfection.

#### Niche Targeting

**Gym Bros Example:**
- Fitness content creators
- High content volume
- Visual-first audience
- Engaged communities

**Why Niches Work:**
- Specific pain points
- Word of mouth within community
- Easier to become known
- Lower competition

### 9.4 '26 Parachute (Contingencies)

#### SimplePoll Outreach
- Similar product in adjacent space
- Potential partnership or acquisition target
- Learning opportunity

#### Paul Klein IV Outreach
