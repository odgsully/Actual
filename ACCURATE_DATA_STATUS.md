# Property Data Accuracy Status

## ‚úÖ What Was Completed

### 1. Database Cleanup - SUCCESSFUL
- **Removed all 16 properties** (8 target + 8 extras)
- Database is now completely clean
- Ready for accurate data only

### 2. Scripts Created
- **`scripts/clean-all-properties.ts`** - Removes ALL properties (works)
- **`scripts/seed-accurate-zillow-properties.ts`** - Real Zillow scraper (may be blocked)
- **`scripts/seed-verified-properties.ts`** - Manual entry with verified data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue: Zillow Blocking

The automated Zillow scraper is being blocked by anti-bot measures. This is common as Zillow actively prevents automated scraping.

## üéØ Solution: Manual Data Entry

### For 12028 N 80TH PL
You mentioned this property should be:
- **4 bedrooms** (not 5)
- **2 bathrooms** (not 4.5)  
- **2,984 sqft** (not 4,200)

This has been corrected in the template.

## üìù Next Steps - YOU NEED TO:

### Option 1: Manual Zillow Data Collection
1. Visit each property on Zillow manually
2. Collect the accurate data:
   - Exact price
   - Bedrooms
   - Bathrooms
   - Square footage
   - Image URLs (right-click ‚Üí Copy Image Address)

3. Update `scripts/seed-verified-properties.ts` with the real data
4. Run: `npx tsx scripts/seed-verified-properties.ts`

### Option 2: Provide Zillow URLs
If you can provide the exact Zillow URLs for each property, we can try:
1. Direct URL scraping (less likely to be blocked)
2. Using a proxy service
3. Adding delays and rotation

### The 8 Properties Needing Data:
1. **7622 N VIA DE MANANA, Scottsdale, AZ 85258**
2. **8347 E VIA DE DORADO DR, Scottsdale, AZ 85258**
3. **6746 E MONTEROSA ST, Scottsdale, AZ 85251**
4. **8520 E TURNEY AVE, Scottsdale, AZ 85251**
5. **12028 N 80TH PL, Scottsdale, AZ 85260** ‚úÖ (4bd/2ba/2,984sqft)
6. **6911 E THUNDERBIRD RD, Scottsdale, AZ 85254**
7. **7043 E HEARN RD, Scottsdale, AZ 85254**
8. **13034 N 48TH PL, Scottsdale, AZ 85254**

## üö´ What NOT to Do
- **NO placeholder data** - leave fields empty rather than guess
- **NO generic images** - only real property photos
- **NO estimated values** - only verified accurate data

## üí° Why This Matters
You specifically noted that 12028 N 80TH PL had wrong data (showing 5bd/4.5ba/4200sqft instead of 4bd/2ba/2984sqft). This proves we need REAL data, not estimates.

## ‚úÖ Database is Clean
The good news: All old/incorrect properties have been removed. The database is ready for accurate data only.

## üîß To Run Scripts:

### Clean Database (already done):
```bash
npx tsx scripts/clean-all-properties.ts
```

### Add Verified Properties (after updating data):
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-verified-properties.ts
```

### Try Zillow Scraper (may be blocked):
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-accurate-zillow-properties.ts
```

## üìä Current Status
- ‚úÖ Extra properties removed (was 16, now 0)
- ‚úÖ Database clean
